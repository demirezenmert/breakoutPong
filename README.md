# Breakout Pong Game

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics module. The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break blocks arranged at the top of the screen.

## Features

- Control a paddle to prevent the ball from falling.
- Break blocks by bouncing the ball against them.
- Simple and intuitive controls.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script to run the game.
- `paddle.py`: Contains the `PADDLE` class to control the paddle.
- `ball.py`: Contains the `BALL` class to control the ball's movement.
- `block.py`: Contains the `BLOCK` class to create and manage blocks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included with Python)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/demirezenmert/breakoutPong.git
    cd breakoutPong
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Game

To run the game, execute the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

- Move paddle left: Press the left arrow key.
- Move paddle right: Press the right arrow key.
- Quit game: Press the 'q' key.

## How to Play

1. Run the game using the instructions above.
2. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle.
3. Bounce the ball to break the blocks.
4. Prevent the ball from falling off the screen using the paddle.
5. The game ends when all blocks are broken or the ball falls off the screen.
