- Break blocks by bouncing the ball against them.
- Simple and intuitive controls.

## Files

- `paddle.py`: Contains the `PADDLE` class to control the paddle.
- `ball.py`: Contains the `BALL` class to control the ball's movement.
- `block.py`: Contains the `BLOCK` class to create and manage blocks.

## Requirements
